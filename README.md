# PythonCS50
# CS50P Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of projects I personally completed as part of Harvard's **CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python** (CS50P). Each project was built **without AI assistance**, focusing on hands-on coding to master Python's core concepts.
_(More projects will be added as I progress through the course.)_


## ðŸ“Œ Course Topics Covered
- Variables, Data Types, and Operators  
- Conditionals and Loops  
- Functions and Recursion

- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Unit Testing and Debugging  
- Web Scraping and API Integration  
- Data Structures and Algorithms  

ðŸŒ± Learning Philosophy
This repository reflects my commitment to learning Python through hands-on coding. No AI-generated codeâ€”just practice, debugging, and real problem-solving.

ðŸ“© Feedback & Contributions
While this is a personal learning repository, I'm always open to feedback! Feel free to create issues or suggest improvements.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
